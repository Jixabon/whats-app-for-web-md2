# Whats app for web MD2

Are you as much of a fan of MD2 as I am? Make your whats app for web look like a MD2 app. To accomplish this I used the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha">Stylebot Chrome extension</a>. 
Once the extension is installed, navigate into the 'options->styles->add new style' of the extension then type in the url for Messages for web (https://messages.android.com) then paste the css from the styles.css file. 
Make sure you install the <a href="https://devfiles.co/download/vSxQjI5P/Google-Sans-Font.zip">Google Sans font</a> as well and boom! You may need to restart chrome in order for it to recognize the new font.

I hope you all enjoy.
If you have any questions on getting it working let me know.
